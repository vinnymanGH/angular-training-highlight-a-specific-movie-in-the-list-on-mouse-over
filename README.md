# Highlight a Specific Movie in the List on Mouse Over

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, we want to highlight movies on mouse over by changing their background color to `gold`.
We want to use a custom directive to do so.

## Requirements
- Edit the provided `src/highlight.directive.ts`
- Add a way for the directive to add the CSS class `highlight` to its host element on mouse over (such CSS class is already defined in `styles.css`)
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Review our self-study content on host bindings and host listeners
- Add a way for the directive to remove the CSS class `highglight` from its host element on mouse out
- Apply the directive on your `MovieItemComponent`

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
